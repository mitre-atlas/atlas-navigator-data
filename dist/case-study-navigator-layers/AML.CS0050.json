    "description": "A security researcher demonstrated a 1-click remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability to the OpenClaw AI Agent via a malicious link containing a JavaScript script that only takes milliseconds to execute. This vulnerability has been reported and is being tracked to versions of OpenClaw as CVE-2026-25253. [<sup>\\[1\\]</sup>][1]  OpenClaw \u201cis a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices. It answers you on the chat apps you already use. Unlike SaaS assistants where your data lives on someone else\u2019s servers, OpenClaw runs where you choose \u2013 laptop, homelab, or VPS. Your infrastructure. Your keys. Your data.\u201d [<sup>\\[2\\]</sup>][2]\n\nThe researcher demonstrated that when the victim clicks a malicious link, a client-side JavaScript script is executed on the victim\u2019s browser that can steal authentication tokens from the OpenClaw control interface via a WebSocket connection. It then uses Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking to bypass localhost restrictions to the OpenClaw Gateway API.  Once the connection was established, it uses the stolen token to authenticate and modify the OpenClaw agent configuration to disable user confirmation and escape the container, allowing shell commands to be run directly on the host machine.\n\n[1]: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25253\n[2]: https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw",
