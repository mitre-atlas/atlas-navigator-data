    "name": "Exposed ClawdBot Control Interfaces Leads to Credential Access and Execution",
    "description": "A security researcher identified hundreds of exposed ClawdBot control interfaces on the public internet. ClawdBot (now OpenClaw) \u201cis a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices. It answers you on the channels you already use \u2026 , plus extension channels. \u2026 It can speak and listen on macOS/iOS/Android, and can render a live Canvas you control.\u201d[<sup>\\[1\\]</sup>][1] The researcher was able to access credentials to a variety of connected applications via ClawdBot\u2019s configuration file. They were also able to invoke ClawdBot\u2019s skills by prompting it via the chat interface, leading to root access in the container.\n\nThe researcher searched Shodan[<sup>\\[2\\]</sup>][2] to identify Clawdbot instances exposed on the public internet, some without authentication enabled. The researcher demonstrated that the ClawdBot\u2019s authentication mechanism could be bypassed due to a proxy misconfiguration.\n\nWith access to ClawdBot\u2019s control interface, they were then able to access ClawdBot\u2019s configuration, which contained credentials to a variety of other services. Across various exposed instances of ClawdBot, they identified Anthropic API Keys, Telegram Bot Tokens, Slack Oauth Credentials, and Signal Device Linking URIs. The researcher prompted ClawdBot directly via the chat interface, which led to exposure of its system prompt. They were also able to get ClawdBot to execute commands via it\u2019s `bash` skill, which at least in once instance led to root access in the ClawdBot container.\n\nThe researcher noted a broad range of other impacts they could have had with this level of access, including:\n-\tManipulation of user chat history with the ClawdBot AI agent\n-\tExfiltration of conversation histories of any connected messaging services\n-\tImpersonation of users by sending messages on their behalf via connected messaging services\n\n[1]: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw\n[2]: https://www.shodan.io/search?query=Clawdbot+Control",
